//Create class IntegerSet for which each object can hold
//integers in the range 0 through 100. A set is
//represented internally as an array of ones and zeros.
//Array element a[ i ] is 1 if integer i is in the set. Array
//element a[ j ] is 0 if integer j is not in the set. The
//default constructor initializes a set to the so-called
//"empty set," i.e., a set whose array representation
//contains all zeros. Provide member functions
//unionOfSets, intersectionOfSets, insertElement,
//deleteElement, printSet, isEqualTo. Provide an
//additional constructor that receives an array of integers
//and the size of that array and uses the array to initialize
//a set object. Write a driver program to test your class.
