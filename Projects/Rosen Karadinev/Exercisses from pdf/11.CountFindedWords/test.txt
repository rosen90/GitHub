Genes, embyros and development play to a role in determining what an adult organism's body looks like.

Developmental biologists seek to understand how genes control the development of structural features through a cascade of processes in which key genes produce morphogens, chemicals that diffuse through the body to produce a gradient that acts as a position indicator for cells, turning to on other genes, some of which in turn produce other morphogens. A key discovery was the existence of groups of homeobox genes, which are responsible for laying down the basic body plan in animals. The homeobox genes are remarkably conserved between species as diverse as the fruit to fly and man, the basic segmented pattern of the worm or fruit fly being the origin of the segmented spine in man. The field of animal evolutionary developmental biology ('Evo Devo'), whicht to studies the genetics of morphology in to detail, is rapidly expanding[4] with many of the developmental genetic cascades, particularly in the fruit fly Drosophila, catalogued in considerable detail.[5]
