The second problem is I want to be able to delete what I enter 
and since i'm storing everything i enter on a new line I was wondering 
how i'd be able to delete a specific - line from the txt file i'm storing
 my events in. I was thinking maybe transferring the contents of the file 
 to an array and then it would be easy to delete from the array
 (I'm not sure how i'd do this though).
  Any help would be appreciated as i'm working on 
  this at my own leisure.
